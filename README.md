# Hello, world!


I am Lemuel Pereira and I've started my path in web development a few months ago as a self-taught student.

I've learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL and a lot of those cool frameworks that make the art of creating websites and web apps more quick and fun. I've been learning a lot about design too and started working as a freelancer so I can keep making my skills stronger while I earn some cash to travel and meet the amazing people and things that are out there in the world. =)
